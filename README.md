Image Classification with Sequential Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Transfer Learning.

## Summary
I can use analyze large datasets using code to determine which machine learning techniques are suitable to apply. I can train machine learning models using a variety of methods to create models with high accuracy. I can document the creation of these models so that my results can be easily be reproduced by others. I can design deep learning networks that use reinforcement learning to increase their accuracy.

I enjoy machine learning and love the way it can be used to perform magical level tasks. I like deep learning especially because it uses the most computing power, and is difficult to understand a single network completely.

I currently plan on making a machine learning algorithm that takes a list of television show info, along with user score to determine recommendations.

In order to keep up with the rapidly changing field, I plan on reading news about machine learning breakthroughs and create models regularly.

I am interested in employment opportunities in a career as a software engineer, data engineer, or machine learning engineer. Please email me at sujay.vadlakonda@gmail.com
